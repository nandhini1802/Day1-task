Firstly HTTP means Hypertext transfer protocol.

Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2
The  first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 solved several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
 One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritises content during the loading process.

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
The variables don’t actually store the value.objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
